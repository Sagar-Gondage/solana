in challnege one i learned about public key and private key in solana.

first when i get the wallet balance it is zero.

now we want to add some sol into wallet balance so to do that we used the async function airDropSol which will add some sols(unit) to the wallet.

if we try to check the wallet balance after adding sols from airDropSol function we will see the upated wallet balance.

Thank you!
